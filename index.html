The purpose of this program is to add responsive images to each paragraph of the Black Goose Bistro Gallery page. 
This will enable a large image to format appropriately to the available space the user has the page opened in. For
instance if open through a mobile device the images will format down to a square and will crop out some of the 
unessential parts of the image.

<!-- Below we are providing multiple image sizes in order for the bread, burger and fish images to crop and tailor to the users viewing enviornment. -->
	
<h1>Blackstone Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<!--
Here we are using the picture element in order to specify multiple image options for the bread image
Belows this code tells the brower if there is a non supporting device use the smaller image. If the 
viewport is 1200 pixels wide or larger then to use the larger bread image. And if it is wider than 
800 pixels then used the middle sized one. This applies to both the burger and fish images below.

<br>We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter.

<br>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>
